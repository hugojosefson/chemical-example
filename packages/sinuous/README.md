# chemical-example / sinuous

This is an example of a client-side webapp, using only native
[ESModules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules).

No build step. All source files run directly in the browser.

This project uses [Sinuous](https://github.com/luxes/sinuous).

## How to use

- Live in browser:
  [packages/sinuous/src/index.html](https://raw.githack.com/hugojosefson/chemical-example/master/packages/sinuous/src/index.html)

Or, serve it yourself via HTTP or HTTPS, and browse to it with a web browser.

For example:

```bash
PORT=3003 npx serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/) in a browser.
