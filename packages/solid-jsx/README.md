# chemical-example / solid-jsx

This project uses [Solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid) and
JSX syntax. There is unfortunately a build step involved... :/

## How to use

Run the build step:

```bash
yarn build
```

Serve it via HTTP or HTTPS, and browse to it with a web browser.

For example:

```bash
yarn start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3002/](http://localhost:3002/) in a browser.
